# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 2025/05/03**

## Introduction
This extension (“the Extension”) is designed to delete tweets on x.com (Twitter) per the user’s instructions. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any data we process.

## Data Collection and Usage
- **Authentication Information**: The Extension intercepts Twitter session headers (such as the authorization token and client UUID) to authenticate tweet-deletion requests.
- **Local Storage**: Any credentials or user preferences (e.g., minimum like count, date filters) are stored **only** in the user’s browser storage.
- **No Third-Party Transfer**: We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your credentials or other data to outside parties.

## Why We Collect This Data
1. **Core Function**: The Extension needs authentication tokens to delete tweets on your behalf.
2. **User Preferences**: Options like “unretweet,” “min like threshold,” etc. are saved locally to provide a customized experience.

## Data Retention
- Authentication tokens and options remain only as long as the user keeps the Extension installed or until they are cleared.
- No external server receives or stores this information.

## Security
- We do not send or store tokens on external servers.
- All logic runs locally within your browser or via Chrome’s secure extension APIs.

## Your Consent
By using the Extension, you consent to this privacy policy and the collection and use of data as described herein. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Extension and remove it from your browser.

## Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to update or change our privacy policy at any time. Any revisions will be posted here with an updated date.
